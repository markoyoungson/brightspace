## Assignment Evaluation Guide (Rubric)

| Criteria/Quality | Limited | Sufficient | Good | Excellent | Unique |
|------------------|---------|------------|------|-----------|---------|
| **1. Deliverables: Sections** | Sections missing or not completed fully | Sections completed but not obvious or basic | Sections generally completed | All sections well developed and all topics explored | Sections well developed with a fresh insight that challenges the readers thinking |
| **2. Thesis/Focus** | Reader cannot determine thesis & purpose OR thesis has no relation to the writing task | Thesis and purpose are somewhat vague OR only loosely related to the writing task | Thesis and purpose are fairly clear and match the writing task | Thesis and purpose are clear to the reader; closely match the writing task | Thesis and purpose are clear and unique; surpassing writing task |
| **3. Organization** | Unclear organization OR organizational plan is inappropriate to thesis. No transitions | Some signs of logical organization. May have abrupt or illogical shifts & ineffective flow of ideas | Organization supports thesis and purpose. Transitions are mostly appropriate. Sequence of ideas could be improved | Fully supports thesis & purpose. Sequence of ideas is effective. Transitions are effective | Fully & imaginatively supports thesis & purpose. Sequence of ideas is effective. Transitions are effective |
| **4. Support/Reasoning (Ideas & Details)** | Offers simplistic, undeveloped, or cryptic support for the ideas. Inappropriate or off-topic generalizations, faulty assumptions, errors of fact | Offers somewhat obvious support that may be too broad. Details are too general, not interpreted, irrelevant to thesis, or inappropriately repetitive | Offers solid but less original reasoning. Assumptions are not always recognized or made explicit. Contains some appropriate details or examples | Substantial, logical, & concrete development of ideas. Assumptions are made explicit. Details are germane, original, and convincingly interpreted | Substantial, logical, & concrete development of ideas with unique outcomes; Assumptions are made explicit. Details are germane, original, and convincingly interpreted |
| **5. Use of Sources/Documentation** | Neglects important sources. Overuse of quotations or paraphrase to substitute writer's own ideas. (Possibly uses source material without acknowledgement.) | Uses relevant sources but lacks in variety of sources and/or the skillful combination of sources. Quotations & paraphrases may be too long and/or inconsistently referenced | Uses sources to support, extend, and inform, but not substitute writer's own development of idea. Doesn't overuse quotes, but may not always conform to required style manual | Uses sources to support, extend, and inform, but not substitute writer's own development of idea. Combines material from a variety of sources, incl. pers. observation, scientific data, authoritative testimony. Doesn't overuse quotes | Uses sources to support, extend, and inform, but not substitute writer's own development of idea. Combines material from a variety of sources, incl. pers. observation, scientific data, authoritative testimony. Doesn't overuse quotes |

## Task Description: Artificial Intelligence in Engineering

### Objective
Students will analyze data and create a report identifying the top three threats (or benefits) that artificial intelligence (AI) could pose to an engineering company. The report should assess the likelihood and potential impact of these developments offering actionable recommendations for leveraging opportunities or mitigating risks.

### Simulated Scenario
You are a newly hired technology analyst at an engineering firm. Your manager has tasked you with evaluating how AI advancements could influence the company's products or operations over the next five years. This information will be critical in shaping the company's strategy to stay competitive and resilient in the fast evolving technological space.
